The official manifesto and principles of Conscientialism.

#WHAT IS CONSCIENTIALISM?

Conscientialism is a social ideology that promotes rational , conscious , and morally responsible living , emphasizing healthy lifestyle choices (such as avoiding harmful habits, eating well, and exercising) , objective thinking , and a belief in God as a moral foundation , and respect for traditional values. It encourages individuals to act with self-discipline , reason , and faith , guiding their behaviour and interactions in society.


#Conscientialism draws inspiration from:

• Rationalism and Objective Reasoning
Encourages making decisions based on logic, facts, and clear thinking rather than impulse or emotion.

• Christian Faith and Traditional Values
Provides a moral and spiritual foundation, guiding ethical behavior and life choices. Faith in God combined with traditional social values, including supporting family life, the desire to have children, and marriage only between a man and a woman.

• Ascetic Lifestyle Principles (Straight Edge)
Complete abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and other harmful behaviors to preserve mind and body.

• Health-Conscious Praxis
Commitment to physical well-being through diet, exercise, and conscious care of the body.
